Using null to represent the absence of a value is the wrong
approach. What you need is a better way to model the absence and presence of a value.

the first temptation of all Java developers when
confronted with a NullPointerException is to quickly fix it by adding an if statement, checking
that a value is not null before invoking a method on it.
