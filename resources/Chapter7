Chapter 7. Parallel data processing and performance

7.1 Parallel streams

A parallel stream is a stream that splits its elements into multiple chunks, processing each chunk with a different thread.
But the last call to parallel or sequential wins and affects the pipeline globally.
the whole list of numbers isnâ€™t available at the beginning of the reduction process, making it
impossible to efficiently partition the stream in chunks to be processed in parallel
