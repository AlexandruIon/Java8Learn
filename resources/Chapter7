Chapter 7. Parallel data processing and performance

7.1 Parallel streams

A parallel stream is a stream that splits its elements into multiple chunks, processing each chunk with a different thread.
But the last call to parallel or sequential wins and affects the pipeline globally.
the whole list of numbers isnâ€™t available at the beginning of the reduction process, making it
impossible to efficiently partition the stream in chunks to be processed in parallel

7.1.3. Using parallel streams correctly
The main cause of errors generated by misuse of parallel streams is the use of algorithms that
mutate some shared state.

7.1.4 Using parallel streams effectively
Some qualitative advice that could be useful when deciding whether it makes sense to use a parallel stream in a
certain situation:
