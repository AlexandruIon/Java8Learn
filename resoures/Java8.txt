6.4. Partitioning
Partitioning is a special case of grouping: having a predicate (a function returning a boolean),
called a partitioning function, as a classification function. The fact that the partitioning function
returns a boolean means the resulting grouping Map will have a Boolean as a key type and
therefore there can be at most two different groupsâ€”one for true and one for false.

6.5. The Collector interface
The Collector interface consists of a set of methods that provide a blueprint for how to
implement specific reduction operations (that is, collectors).
